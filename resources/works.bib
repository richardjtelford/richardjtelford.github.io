  abstract = {Reference total nitrogen (TN) concentrations for the Gårdsfjärden estuary in the central Bothnian Sea, which receives discharge from an industrial point-source, have been estimated from diatom assemblages using a transfer function. Sedimentological and diatom evidence imply a good ecological status before 1920 with an assemblage dominated by benthic taxa indicating excellent water transparency, high diatom species richness and less organic sedimentation resulting in homogeneous well oxygenated sediments. A change in the diatom assemblage starts between 1920 and 1935 when the species richness declines and the proportion of planktic taxa increases. Increased organic carbon sedimentation after 1920 led to hypoxic bottom waters, and the preservation of laminae in the sediments. The trend in the reconstructed TN-values agrees with the history of the discharge from the mill, reaching maximum impact during the high discharge between 1945 and 1990. The background condition for TN in Gårdsfjärden is 260–300 μg L−1, reconstructed until 1920.},

  abstract  = {Palaeotemperature reconstructions based on radiocarbon-dated fossil pollen and chironomid stratigraphies obtained from Lake Gilltjärnen provide evidence of climate changes during the last 11 000 years in the boreal zone of northern central Sweden. The records show consistent trends during the early and mid-Holocene, indicating low temperatures at 11 000–10 000 cal. yr BP, followed by a rising trend and a period of maximum values from about 7000 to 4000 cal. yr BP. At 3000 cal. yr BP the chironomid-inferred temperature values rise abruptly, deviating from the late-Holocene cooling trend indicated by the pollen-based reconstruction and most of the other palaeotemperature records from central Scandinavia, probably as a result of local limnological changes in Lake Gilltjärnen and its catchment. Comparison of the present results with a lake-level reconstruction from Lake Ljustjärnen, ca. 100 km southwest of Lake Gilltjärnen, shows that the low early-Holocene temperatures were associated with high lake-levels at 10 500–8500 cal. yr BP, whereas low lake-levels and dry conditions prevailed during the period of high temperatures at between 7500 and 5000 cal. yr BP, probably due to high summer evapotranspiration and lower precipitation.

Abrupt shifts of up to 18 per mil in the oxygen isotope ratio of diatom silica have been found in a 14,000-year record from two alpine lakes on Mt. Kenya.

Episodes of heavy convective precipitation dated \~{}11,100 to 8600, 6700 to 5600, 2900 to 1900, and \&lt;1300 years before the present were linked to enhanced soil erosion, neoglacial ice advances, and forest expansion on Mt.

  abstract = {Diatom genera in many large East African lakes change little throughout the Holocene period suggesting relatively stable ecological conditions and some resilience to environmental change. Ecosystem stability is less common in smaller, more sensitive lakes, such as those within volcanic craters, where external impacts can cause abrupt and rapid fluctuations. A 4100-year diatom and cyanobacteria pigment record from Lake Massoko, a volcanic crater lake in southern Tanzania, is used to illustrate important switches in resource ratios following tephra deposition 1190 years ago. It is hypothesized that the tephra reduced the rate of P diffusion from the sediments and increased the Si:P ratio in the lake. A period of acute change in planktonic diatom communities resulted from the tephra impact and lasted c. 110 years. The magnitude of the change shown by the diatoms and their slow recovery from the tephra may be due in part to a coincident fall in lake level caused by a reduction in regional rainfall. The statistical significance of the tephra impact relative to that of catchment and climate change has been tested using variance partitioning and rate-of-change analysis. Multiproxy indicators show an important period of positive water balance 1700 ago and a relatively dry episode persisting between 1000 and 400 years ago. The lake ecosystem is shown to be highly sensitive to both climate change and tephra deposition.},

  abstract = {Palaeoecology and ecology have a lot in common. However, the two disciplines have evolved almost separately, leading to an ongoing debate on how to link them better, as both would undoubtedly benefit from a higher degree of cross-fertilisation of ideas, research insights and questions. In this paper, we explore similarities and differences in the two branches of ecology over the past 40 years by assessing the publication output from an unusually large cohort of ‘academic siblings’ – researchers in ecology and palaeoecology who all share one of the strongest career-shaping influences on researchers; their supervisor. This was made possible by John Birks’ long and active career within ecology and palaeoecology, and his supervision of a large number of students in both fields (n = 12 and 21, respectively). Among them, John Birks’ academic progeny has published 934 papers in the international peer-reviewed literature. We collected information on the year, titles, keywords and journals of all these publications and used these data to assess the extent of, and find potential explanations for, the historical and present-day separation of ecology and palaeoecology. Despite considerable thematic overlap, there is a real and possibly widening division between the two branches that is visible both at the scale of individual research careers, journals and papers. We argue that rather than being unique to the relationship between palaeoecology and ecology, this reflects trends for thematic and methodological specialisation evident across the research landscape. We propose that both individual researchers and journals would benefit from, and can contribute to, closing the gaps developing between various ‘special branches’ in science. A good title, an informative abstract, a careful and thought-through selection of keywords and a focus on readability and avoidance of jargon will likely improve readership and impact both within one’s own ‘special branch’ and beyond.},

  abstract = {Loch Ruthven holds the largest British population of the rare water-bird Podiceps auritus, the Slavonian or horned grebe. The breeding success of this bird has fluctuated annually since records began in 1970. To investigate whether these trends are linked to the abundance of chironomid midges, which are an important food-source for the grebe chicks, we analysed a sediment core from the lake, which was sliced at 2.5-mm intervals and provided near-annual sampling resolution. We also analysed diatoms and algal pigments in the lake sediments and inferred changes in total phosphorus from the diatom assemblage to determine whether changes in lake productivity have influenced the abundance of chironomids. Trends in grebe productivity, chironomid abundance and algal assemblages were compared against climate data to determine whether climate, specifically, the North Atlantic Oscillation, was the ultimate driver of the trends we recorded. Our results show that grebe breeding success is positively correlated with chironomid abundance and chironomid abundance is positively correlated with diatom-inferred total phosphorus. Lake productivity and chironomid abundance began to rise early in the twentieth century and continued to rise on a steeper trajectory from the mid-twentieth century to the present. Since the mid-1960s, chironomid abundance began to fluctuate erratically and since 1970 was in phase with grebe productivity, with the grebe trends most plausibly lagging by 1 year. These trends appear to correlate with inter-annual fluctuations in diatom-inferred total phosphorus. No correlation was found between grebe productivity or chironomid abundance and climate variables, suggesting that the size of the chironomid population and breeding success of Podiceps auritus at Loch Ruthven is resource-linked.},

  abstract  = {The lack of a precisely-dated, unequivocal climate proxy from northern China, where precipitation variability is traditionally considered as an East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) indicator, impedes our understanding of the behaviour and dynamics of the EASM. Here we present a well-dated, pollen-based, ~20-yr-resolution quantitative precipitation reconstruction (derived using a transfer function) from an alpine lake in North China, which provides for the first time a direct record of EASM evolution since 14.7 ka (ka = thousands of years before present, where the “present” is defined as the year AD 1950). Our record reveals a gradually intensifying monsoon from 14.7-7.0 ka, a maximum monsoon (30% higher precipitation than present) from ~7.8-5.3 ka, and a rapid decline since ~3.3 ka. These insolation-driven EASM trends were punctuated by two millennial-scale weakening events which occurred synchronously to the cold Younger Dryas and at ~9.5-8.5 ka, and by two centennial-scale intervals of enhanced (weakened) monsoon during the Medieval Warm Period (Little Ice Age). Our precipitation reconstruction, consistent with temperature changes but quite different from the prevailing view of EASM evolution, points to strong internal feedback processes driving the EASM, and may aid our understanding of future monsoon behaviour under ongoing anthropogenic climate change.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the evaluation of pollen-based quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions focuses on the ability of calibration sets to infer present climatic conditions and/or the similarity between fossil and modern assemblages. Objective criteria for choosing the most appropriate climate parameter(s) to be reconstructed at a specific site are thus lacking. Using a novel approach for testing the statistical significance of a quantitative reconstruction using random environmental data, in combination with the advantageous large environmental gradients, abundant vegetation types and comprehensive modern pollen databases in China, we describe a new procedure for pollen-based quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions. First, the most significant environmental variable controlling the fossil pollen assemblage changes is identified. Second, a calibration set to infer changes in this targeted variable is built up, by limiting the modern ranges of other environmental variables. Finally, the pollen-based quantitative reconstruction is obtained and its statistical significance assessed. This novel procedure was used to reconstruct the mean annual precipitation (P ann) from Gonghai Lake in the Lvliang Mountains, and Tianchi Lake in the Liupan Mountains, on the eastern and western fringe of the Chinese Loess Plateau, respectively. Both P ann reconstructions are statistically significant (p<0.001), and a sound and stable correlation relationship exists in their common period, showing a rapid precipitation decrease since 3300 cal yr BP. Thus, we propose that this procedure has great potential for reducing the uncertainties associated with pollen-based quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions in China.},

A multiproxy approach using geochemical and biological indicators and diatom-based transfer functions provides a long-term perspective on changes in nutrient concentrations and the corresponding biological and sedimentary responses. In Roskilde Fjord, Denmark, total nitrogen (TN) increased 85% during the last century, with the most rapid increase occurring after the 1950s, corresponding to the postwar increase in N fertilizer use. In Laajalahti Bay, an urban embayment near Helsinki, Finland, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) increased with growing wastewater inputs and decreased with the remedial actions taken to reduce these discharges. These changes are small relative to the order of magnitude increases in nutrient loading that have occurred in northwestern Europe, where the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) load has increased more than threefold in certain areas.},

  abstract = {Background: Newly protected, tropical forests recovering from logging and clearance are increasingly important targets for conservation. Recovery is typically evaluated or monitored by using a few easily identified species groups, but this may not be sufficient as unmonitored groups of equivalent ecological importance are unlikely to respond in a similar manner due to physiological or dispersal differences.Aims: We compared four groups of plants: large trees, shrubs and saplings, herbs and ferns in a forest recovering from disturbance. We quantified the relative importance of disturbance history and local environmental conditions in determining species richness and community composition of these groups and assessed whether the groups could act as surrogate indicators for one another.Methods: Vegetation was surveyed on a gradient of disturbance intensity and recovery time (20–60 years) in Mabira Forest, Uganda. We looked for correlations between species groups in richness or composition across sites and used constrained ordinations to identify important environmental variables.Results: Neither species richness nor composition patterns were correlated between groups. All groups were weakly related to disturbance history; trees and shrubs were related to soil, herbs to microhabitat and ferns to microclimate.Conclusions: No group acted as an indicator for another. The relative influence of disturbance and local environmental effects varied in the manner predicted, with disturbance stronger for trees and environment stronger for ferns.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant functional traits vary consistently along climate gradients and are therefore potential predictors of plant community response to climate change. We test this space-for-time assumption by combining a spatial gradient study with whole-community turf transplantation along temperature and precipitation gradients in a network of 12 grassland sites in Southern Norway. Using data on eight traits for 169 species and annual vegetation censuses of 235 turfs over 5 yr, we quantify trait-based responses to climate change by comparing observed community dynamics in transplanted turfs to field-parameterized null model simulations. Three traits related to species architecture (maximum height, number of dormant meristems, and ramet-ramet connection persistence) varied consistently along spatial temperature gradients and also correlated to changes in species abundances in turfs transplanted to warmer climates. Two traits associated with resource acquisition strategy (SLA, leaf area) increased along spatial temperature gradients but did not correlate to changes in species abundances following warming. No traits correlated consistently with precipitation. Our study supports the hypothesis that spatial associations between plant traits and broad-scale climate variables can be predictive of community response to climate change, but it also suggests that not all traits with clear patterns along climate gradients will necessarily influence community response to an equal degree.},

  abstract = {We compare six high-resolution Holocene, sediment cores along a S–N transect on the Norwegian–Svalbard continental margin from ca 60°N to 77.4°N, northern North Atlantic. Planktonic foraminifera in the cores were investigated to show the changes in upper surface and subsurface water mass distribution and properties, including summer sea-surface temperatures (SST). The cores are located below the axis of the Norwegian Current and the West Spitsbergen Current, which today transport warm Atlantic Water to the Arctic. Sediment accumulation rates are generally high at all the core sites, allowing for a temporal resolution of 10–102 years. \{SST\} is reconstructed using different types of transfer functions, resulting in very similar \{SST\} trends, with deviations of no more than ±1.0/1.5 °C. A transfer function based on the maximum likelihood statistical approach is found to be most relevant. The reconstruction documents an abrupt change in planktonic foraminiferal faunal composition and an associated warming at the Younger Dryas–Preboreal transition. The earliest part of the Holocene was characterized by large temperature variability, including the Preboreal Oscillations and the 8.2 k event. In general, the early Holocene was characterized by \{SSTs\} similar to those of today in the south and warmer than today in the north, and a smaller S–N temperature gradient (0.23 °C/°N) compared to the present temperature gradient (0.46 °C/°N). The southern proxy records (60–69°N) were more strongly influenced by slightly cooler subsurface water probably due to the seasonality of the orbital forcing and increased stratification due to freshening. The northern records (72–77.4°N) display a millennial-scale change associated with reduced insolation and a gradual weakening of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). The observed northwards amplification of the early Holocene warming is comparable to the pattern of recent global warming and future climate modelling, which predicts greater warming at higher latitudes. The overall trend during mid and late Holocene was a cooling in the north, stable or weak warming in the south, and a maximum S–N \{SST\} gradient of ca 0.7 °C/°N at 5000 cal. years BP. Superimposed on this trend were several abrupt temperature shifts. Four of these shifts, dated to 9000–8000, 5500–3000 and 1000 and ∼400 cal. years BP, appear to be global, as they correlate with periods of global climate change. In general, there is a good correlation between the northern North Atlantic temperature records and climate records from Norway and Svalbard.},

The procedure uses mid-point estimates of the calibrated ages in combination with the central distributional range as the basis for estimating the fixed relationship between age and depth. Further, it combines the variability of the calibrated age at individual layers (within-object variance) with estimation of the variability of the calibrated age distribution as a whole between the layers standardized by the fixed effect (between-object variance). These components of random variability can be considered independent, and hence the uncertainty of the estimated fixed relationship between age and depth can be estimated by combining the two random variables. The procedure follows the logic of mixed-effects models, but with prior information about the expected variance within each dated object.},

  abstract = {In a rapidly changing climate, alpine plants may persist by adapting to new conditions. However, the rate at which the climate is changing might exceed the rate of adaptation through evolutionary processes in long-lived plants. Persistence may depend on phenotypic plasticity in morphology and physiology. Here we investigated patterns of leaf trait variation including leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nutrients (C, N, P) and isotopes (δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N) across an elevation gradient on Gongga Mountain, Sichuan Province, China. We quantified inter- and intra-specific trait variation and the plasticity in leaf traits of selected species to experimental warming and cooling by using a reciprocal transplantation approach. We found substantial phenotypic plasticity in most functional traits where δ<sup>15</sup>N, leaf area, and leaf P showed greatest plasticity. These traits did not correspond with traits with the largest amount of intraspecific variation. Plasticity in leaf functional traits tended to enable plant populations to shift their trait values toward the mean values of a transplanted plants’ destination community, but only if that population started with very different trait values. These results suggest that leaf trait plasticity is an important mechanism for enabling plants to persist within communities and to better tolerate changing environmental conditions under climate change.},

  abstract  = {Background Although arctic lakes have responded sensitively to 20th-century climate change, it remains uncertain how these ecological transformations compare with alpine and montane-boreal counterparts over the same interval. Furthermore, it is unclear to what degree other forcings, including atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr), have participated in recent regime shifts. Diatom-based paleolimnological syntheses offer an effective tool for retrospective assessments of past and ongoing changes in remote lake ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings We synthesized 52 dated sediment diatom records from lakes in western North America and west Greenland, spanning broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and representing alpine (n = 15), arctic (n = 20), and forested boreal-montane (n = 17) ecosystems. Diatom compositional turnover (β-diversity) during the 20th century was estimated using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) for each site and compared, for cores with sufficiently robust chronologies, to both the 19th century and the prior ∼250 years (Little Ice Age). For both arctic and alpine lakes, β-diversity during the 20th century is significantly greater than the previous 350 years, and increases with both latitude and altitude. Because no correlation is apparent between 20th-century diatom β-diversity and any single physical or limnological parameter (including lake and catchment area, maximum depth, pH, conductivity, [NO3−], modeled Nr deposition, ambient summer and winter air temperatures, and modeled temperature trends 1948–2008), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to summarize the amplitude of recent changes in relationship to lake pH, lake:catchment area ratio, modeled Nr deposition, and recent temperature trends. Conclusions/Significance The ecological responses of remote lakes to post-industrial environmental changes are complex. However, two regions reveal concentrations of sites with elevated 20th-century diatom β-diversity: the Arctic where temperatures are increasing most rapidly, and mid-latitude alpine lakes impacted by high Nr deposition rates. We predict that remote lakes will continue to shift towards new ecological states in the Anthropocene, particularly in regions where these two forcings begin to intersect geographically.},

Most models use all but the rarest taxa present in the training set, even though many may be unrelated to the environmental variable of interest. We hypothesise that retaining such non-informative taxa will reduce model robustness and present a method for variable selection motivated by the statistical learning algorithm in random forests. We apply our species-pruning algorithm into weighted averaging (WA) and maximum likelihood calibration of response curves (MLRCs), and compare results of boosted regression trees (BRTs) using artificial and real datasets. Results from the artificial data show that WA is particularly sensitive to the influence of both non-informative taxa and secondary environmental variables in the training set or fossil assemblage, and that BRTs are relatively immune to these effects. Furthermore, species-pruned WA and MLRCs offer substantial improvements over all-species models when the training set includes non-informative taxa but does not guard against confounding effects when species have bi- or multivariate responses to the primary and one or more secondary variables. Tests with a limited set of examples of real data indicate that BRTs, MLRCs or species-pruned models have no apparent advantage over WA. We discuss possible reasons for this contradiction and suggest that more tests are needed to properly evaluate BRTs and species-pruned models.},

  Abstract                 = {Transfer functions produce quantitative reconstructions of relative sea level from microfossil assemblages (e.g., intertidal diatoms or foraminifera). The relationship between tidal elevation and microfossil assemblages is established from field-based observations in modern environments and formalized through an appropriate numerical technique (the transfer function). Application of the empirically derived transfer function to microfossil assemblages preserved in sedimentary archives generates quantitative reconstructions of paleotidal elevation with uncertainty. The principal concepts of using transfer functions to reconstruct sea level are presented and discussed with illustrative examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract The progress of science is tied to the standardization of measurements, instruments, and data. This is especially true in the Big Data age, where analyzing large data volumes critically hinges on the data being standardized. Accordingly, the lack of community-sanctioned data standards in paleoclimatology has largely precluded the benefits of Big Data advances in the field. Building upon recent efforts to standardize the format and terminology of paleoclimate data, this article describes the Paleoclimate Community reporTing Standard (PaCTS), a crowdsourced reporting standard for such data. PaCTS captures which information should be included when reporting paleoclimate data, with the goal of maximizing the reuse value of paleoclimate data sets, particularly for synthesis work and comparison to climate model simulations. Initiated by the LinkedEarth project, the process to elicit a reporting standard involved an international workshop in 2016, various forms of digital community engagement over the next few years, and grassroots working groups. Participants in this process identified important properties across paleoclimate archives, in addition to the reporting of uncertainties and chronologies; they also identified archive-specific properties and distinguished reporting standards for new versus legacy data sets. This work shows that at least 135 respondents overwhelmingly support a drastic increase in the amount of metadata accompanying paleoclimate data sets. Since such goals are at odds with present practices, we discuss a transparent path toward implementing or revising these recommendations in the near future, using both bottom-up and top-down approaches.},

  abstract  = {Millimetre-scale white aragonite laminations alternating with dark diatom-rich organic layers are present in the uppermost sediments of the crater lakes Hora and Babogaya, at Debre Zeit, Ethiopia. The sediment accumulation rate calculated from lamina counts matches that estimated from a 210Pb chronology, indicating that the laminations were deposited annually. The oxygen-isotope composition of the surface white layer is equivalent to that of surface water, which shows that white-layer aragonite is formed in isotopic equilibrium with the lake water, and suggests that isotopic analyses of these layers may provide valid paleoclimatic information. Because the aragonite is probably precipitated during dry-season mixing, aragonite $\delta$18O values for individual laminae reflect the composition of the entire lake, integrated over its water-residence time of about 10 years. The sedimentary record of oxygen-isotope variations should therefore be interpreted as a proxy-climate record with decadal rather than annual resolution. Comparisons between $\delta$18O values for the laminae and climate data for equivalent years show no clear relationships, so calibration of the sedimentary record requires a more detailed understanding of the climatic controls on the isotopic composition of these groundwater-fed lakes. An isotopic mass-balance model of the lake's response to rainfall variation shows (1) that the oxygen isotope composition of the lake waters varies by about 1 {\texttenthousand}, which is comparable to the range of $\delta$18O values determined from the individual laminae; and (2) that modelled lake level is a reasonable match to observed levels, confirming that climate changes can interpreted from the oxygen-isotope record.},

Diatom stratigraphy shows that the lake remained deep enough to support planktonic taxa, and was never saline. The record suggests that rainfall was higher than that of the twentieth century during most of this time, especially during two short intervals centred on AD 700 and AD 1300. Climate was drier only around AD 800, and from AD 1750—1900. Similar, but slightly moister climate than today, with high interdecadal variability, prevailed from AD 800 to AD 1200, equivalent to the European `Mediaeval Warm Period'. A period of high effective precipitation followed, from AD 1200 to AD 1700, during the `Little Ice Age'. Pollen evidence suggests that increased forest cover from AD 1400 to AD 1750 was a response to higher rainfall; forest cover may have increased evaporative loss from the catchment, contributing to a subsequent trend of increasing lakewater δ18O values.The record shows similarities in the timing and direction of changes in proxy-climatic records from Lake Naivasha (Kenya) and from the Nile.},

Melanoides is particularly important because it is widespread in Quaternary deposits throughout Africa and Asia and is ubiquitous in both fresh and highly evaporated lakes. Whole-shell and incremental growth data were collected from modern and fossil shells from two lakes in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. $\delta$18O values in the modern shells from Lake Awassa are in equilibrium with modern waters, while $\delta$18O values in subfossil shells from the margins of Lake Tilo indicate high rainfall during the early Holocene. Sequential analysis along the growth spiral of the shell provides information on seasonal or shorter-term variability of lake water during the lifetime of the organism.},

In order to better understand the interactions between ocean, atmosphere and ice sheet stability during the YD, more high-resolution proxy records from the Arctic, located proximal to ice sheet outlet glaciers, are required. Here we present the first diatom-based high-resolution quantitative reconstruction of sea surface conditions from central-eastern Baffin Bay, covering the period 14.0-10.2 kyr BP. Our record reveals warmer sea surface conditions and strong interactions between the ocean and the West Greenland ice margin during the YD. These warmer conditions were caused by increased Atlantic-sourced water inflow combined with amplified seasonality. Our results emphasize the importance of the ocean for ice sheet stability under the current changing climate.},

In contrast to traditional training-set design with one observation per site, some training-sets, including those for peatland testate amoeba-hydrology transfer functions, have a clustered structure with many observations from each site. Here we show that this clustered design causes standard performance statistics to be overly optimistic. Model performance when applied to independent data sets is considerably weaker than suggested by statistical cross-validation. We discuss the reasons for these problems and describe leave-one-site-out cross-validation and the cluster bootstrap as appropriate methods for clustered training-sets. Using these methods we show that the performance of most testate amoeba-hydrology transfer functions is worse than previously assumed and reconstructions are more uncertain.},

We test the methods using a new, 113-sample calibration set from Estonia, Lithuania and European Russia, and a Holocene fossil pollen sequence from Lake Kharinei, a previously studied lake in northeast European Russia. We find WA-PLS to outperform WA, probably because of smaller edge-effect biases in the ends of the calibration set gradient. The Bayesian-based calibration models show further improved performance compared with WA-PLS in leave-one-out cross-validation, while additional h-block cross-validation shows the Bayesian method to be little affected by spatial autocorrelation. Comparison with independent climate proxies reveals, however, some clear biases in the Bayesian palaeotemperature reconstructions, likely reflecting in part some specific limitations of our calibration set. As the selected prior parameters can significantly affect both Bayesian cross-validation performance and reconstructions, there is a clear need to further test the Bayesian method in different geographic contexts and over different timescales, with special attention given to the selection of the most realistic priors in each situation. In general, our finding that statistically well-performing transfer functions may produce clearly differing palaeotemperature reconstructions urges caution in transfer function-based inferences. We additionally test a spatially restricted, 58-sample subset of the full 113-sample calibration set. We find some reduced biases with the smaller set, likely because of complex, partially bimodal responses of several taxa along the longer temperature gradient, ill-suited for calibration methods assuming unimodal responses to climate.},

Its shelf-edge branch, the Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current (NwASC), is of particular interest as it seems to be the main conduit for advected heat towards the Arctic. The objective of this study was to investigate northward oceanic heat transport in the NwASC on longer, geologically meaningful time scales. To this end, we reconstructed variations in the strength of the NwASC over the late Holocene using the sortable-silt method. We then analysed the statistical relationship between our palaeo-flow reconstructions and published upper-ocean hydrography proxy records from the same location on the mid-Norwegian Margin. Our sortable-silt time series show prominent multi-decadal to multi-centennial variability, but no clear long-term trend over the past 4200 years. These records we thus interpret to represent perturbations in a relatively stable late-Holocene mean flow. Our in-depth statistical analysis indicates that upper-ocean temperatures at the mid-Norwegian Margin may have varied independently from the strength of the NwASC on multi-decadal to multi-centennial time scales over the past few millennia.},

Evidence of the utility of some of these reconstructions is given by the high correlations between the reconstructions and instrumental records.

This paper explores these timescale dependent issues and tests the reproducibility of the several of published reconstructions. It demonstrates that the previously reported exceptionally good performance of several published chironomid-based reconstructions is not reproducible.},

Realistic estimates of the predictive power of a transfer function can only be calculated from an independent test set. If the test set is not fully independent, the error estimate will be artificially low. We show that the modern analogue technique using a similarity index (SIMMAX) and the revised analogue method (RAM), both derived from the modern analogue technique, achieve apparently lower root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) by failing to ensure statistical independence of samples during cross validation. We also show that when cross validation is used to select the best artificial neural network or modern analogue model, the RMSEP based on cross validation is lower than that for a fully independent test set.},

We find that cross-validated estimates of the root mean squared error of prediction can be strongly biased if the observations are very unevenly distributed along the environmental gradient. This biased occurs because species optima are more precisely known (and more analogues are available) in the part of the gradient with most observations, hence estimates are most precise here, and compensate for the less precise estimates in the less well sampled parts of the gradient. We find that weighted averaging and the modern analogue technique are more sensitive to this problem than maximum likelihood, and suggest a way to remove the bias via a segment-wise RMSEP procedure.},

Conductivity was high from {\textasciitilde}6400-6200 BP, and from 5200-4000 BP, with two brief episodes of lower conductivity during the latter period. Although the timing of the conductivity changes is similar to the timing of lake-level change in the nearby Zwai-Shalla basin, their directions are the reverse of that expected from a climatic cause. Dissolution of the tephras which precede both phases of high conductivity cannot explain the increases in salinity, because rhyolitic tephras are only sparingly soluble. Instead, the pulsed input of groundwater made saline by the reaction of silicate minerals and volcanic glass with carbonic acid, formed from the solution of carbon dioxide degassed from magma under the Awassa Caldera, is suggested as a plausible mechanism for the observed change in lake chemistry. Diatom-inferred hydrochemistry cannot therefore be used to reconstruct climate change in Lake Awassa.},

This conflicts with previous work, which shows that many diatom taxa have a statistically significant relationship with pH. We demonstrate the methods used by Pither & Aarssen (2005) have a high Type II error for rare taxa, and that this problem is compounded by the non-uniform sampling of the pH gradient which effectively precludes acid-lake specialist diatoms from being recognized as such. We re-analyse the data used by Pither & Aarssen (2005) and show that most of the diatoms have a statistically significant relationship with pH, and we thus refute their conclusions that few diatom species are specialists.},

Four widely used age–depth modelling routines – CLAM, OxCal, Bacon and Bchron – were tested using radiocarbon dates simulated from varved sediment stratigraphies. All methods produce mean age–depth models that are close to the true varve age, but the uncertainty estimation differs considerably among models. Age uncertainties are usually underestimated by CLAM, whereas age uncertainties produced by Bchron are often too large. With OxCal and Bacon, the setting of model-specific parameters influences the estimated uncertainties, which vary from too large to too small. The variability of sediment accumulation rates is underestimated by CLAM but overestimated by Bacon and Bchron. Bayesian age–depth models mainly improve the assessment of uncertainties of age–depth models.},

  abstract = {Remnant forest fragments provide an opportunity for conservation in fragmented landscapes but some patches are more useful than others. Forest fragments around Budongo Forest Reserve, an Important Bird Area in western Uganda, were surveyed to explore the effects of different aspects of habitat fragmentation on bird guild composition. We recorded 1 128 individuals of 75 bird species over 7 056 net hours. The greatest number of birds and species were recorded in the forest fragments that were large, near to the continuous forest and surrounded by subsistence farmland. However, rarefied species richness was not affected by distance, size or matrix type; instead, forest specialist species were replaced by generalists and visitors with increasing fragmentation. The proportion of forest specialists and of terrestrial insectivores decreased with distance from the main forest, canopy openness and matrix intensity but not with fragment area. The findings show that bird assemblages vary in their response to habitat fragmentation but within guilds the response to fragmentation can be consistent, and can make ecological sense. Forest bird conservation can therefore benefit from information on species ecology when deciding which bird species and which parts of the landscape are to be prioritised for conservation or monitoring purposes.},

  abstract = {Most calibration data sets used to infer past environmental conditions from biological proxies are derived from many sites. An alternative strategy is to derive the calibration data set from within a single site. Transfer functions derived from such intra-site calibration data sets are usually applied to fossil assemblages from the focal lake, but a recent development has been to apply these transfer functions to other sites. Transfer functions derived from intra-site calibration data sets can have impressive cross-validation performance, but that gives little indication of their performance when applied to other sites. Here, we develop transfer functions for lake depth from intra-lake chironomid calibration data sets in Norway and Alaska and test the resulting models by cross-validation and against known depth in external lakes. Lake depth is a statistically significant predictor of chironomid assemblages at all these lakes, and most intra-lake transfer functions perform reasonably well under cross-validation, but their performance against external data is erratic. Downcore reconstructions from transfer functions developed on different lakes are dissimilar. Ignoring the poorly performing transfer functions, only 3 of 14 downcore reconstructions are statistically significant. Few assemblages downcore had good modern analogues in the calibration data set, even when the core was from the same lake as the calibration data set. We conclude that intra-site calibration data sets can find site-specific rather than general relationships between species and the environment and thus should be applied with care and to external sites only after careful and critical validation.},

  abstract  = {The past of the Baltic Sea has been intensively investigated using a wealth of techniques. By far the largest number of studies has focused on sea level and salinity changes, driven by global climate and isostatic crustal rebound after the Baltic Sea emerged underneath the Weichselian Ice Sheet ca. 15,000 cal. years BP. The post-glacial history of the Baltic has included both freshwater and brackish water stages depending on the connection of the Baltic Sea with the world's oceans. As the Baltic is one of the most polluted sea areas in the world, many studies have also focused on both the long-term trends in nutrients and productivity and the relatively recent anthropogenic eutrophication. The long-term changes in the trophic state of the Baltic Sea have been found to be linked to changes in climate, which controls freshwater discharge from the catchment and weathering rates, as well as marine water inflow from the North Sea. The productivity of the Baltic Sea has followed major climate patterns: it was high during warm periods and lower during phases of deteriorating climate. Recent eutrophication of the Baltic Sea can mainly be explained by a marked increase in discharge of nutrients caused by a growing population and changes in the agricultural practice, although long-term climate variability also plays a part. Signs of recovery have recently been detected, however, the Baltic Sea is still far from its pre-industrial trophic state.},

  abstract = {Long-term monitoring, space-for-time substitutions along gradients, and in situ temperature manipulations are common approaches to understand effects of climate change on alpine and arctic plant communities. Although general patterns emerge from studies using different approaches, there are also some inconsistencies. To provide better estimates of plant community responses to future warming across a range of environments, there have been repeated calls for integrating different approaches within single studies. Thus, to examine how different methods in climate change effect studies may ask different questions, we combined three climate warming approaches in a single study in the Hengduan Mountains of southwestern China. We monitored plant communities along an elevation gradient using the space-for-time approach, and conducted warming experiments using open top chambers (OTCs) and plant community transplantation toward warmer climates along the same gradient. Plant species richness and abundances were monitored over 5 years addressing two questions: (1) how do plant communities respond to the different climate warming approaches? (2) how can the combined approaches improve predictions of plant community responses to climate change? The general trend across all three approaches was decreased species richness with climate warming at low elevations. This suggests increased competition from immigrating lowland species, and/or from the species already growing inside the plots, as indicated by increased biomass, vegetation height or proportion of graminoids. At the coldest sites, species richness decreased in OTCs and along the gradient, but increased in the transplants, suggesting that plant communities in colder climates are more open to invasion from lowland species, with slow species loss. This was only detected in the transplants, showing that different approaches, may yield different results. Whereas OTCs may constrain immigration of new species, transplanted communities are rapidly exposed to new neighbors that can easily colonize the small plots. Thus, different approaches ask slightly different questions, in particular regarding indirect climate change effects, such as biotic interactions. To better understand both direct and indirect effects of climate change on plant communities, we need to combine approaches in future studies, and if novel interactions are of particular interest, transplants may be a better approach than OTCs.},

  abstract     = {Evidence of climate change impacts on biodiversity is accumulating, but a growing literature also reveals highly variable rates and even directions of these responses. We propose that this complexity arises because biological processes do not respond to climate in direct and linear ways and, therefore, that complex biodiversity responses could be simplified by rescaling climate in terms of the underlying biological processes. Applying this {\textquotedblleft}plant{\textquoteright}s eye view{\textquotedblright} approach to a montane grassland climate change experiment, we find that variation in local extinction and colonization rates in response to temperature and precipitation change across landscapes emerge from unexpected and understudied biotic interactions. Thus, biotic rescaling can simultaneously test mechanistic hypotheses and enhance generality in understanding of biodiversity responses to climate change.Generality in understanding biodiversity responses to climate change has been hampered by substantial variation in the rates and even directions of response to a given change in climate. We propose that such context dependencies can be clarified by rescaling climate gradients in terms of the underlying biological processes, with biotic interactions as a particularly important process. We tested this rescaling approach in a replicated field experiment where entire montane grassland communities were transplanted in the direction of expected temperature and/or precipitation change. In line with earlier work, we found considerable variation across sites in community dynamics in response to climate change. However, these complex context dependencies could be substantially reduced or eliminated by rescaling climate drivers in terms of proxies of plant-plant interactions. Specifically, bryophytes limited colonization by new species into local communities, whereas the cover of those colonists, along with bryophytes, were the primary drivers of local extinctions. These specific interactions are relatively understudied, suggesting important directions for future work in similar systems. More generally, the success of our approach in explaining and simplifying landscape-level variation in climate change responses suggests that developing and testing proxies for relevant underlying processes could be a fruitful direction for building more general models of biodiversity response to climate change.The plant community, climate, and site data used in this paper are deposited in a public Open Science Framework (OSF) project, https://osf.io/8y4mk/ (43).

  abstract = {Intercept-based methods of generating a point estimate of a calibrated radiocarbon date are very popular, but exhibit undesirable behaviour. They are highly sensitive to the mean of the radiocarbon date and to adjustments of the calibration curve. Other methods give more stable results. The weighted average of the probability distribution function is recommended as the best central-point estimate, but more consideration should be given to using the full probability distribution rather than a point estimate in developing age-depth models.},
